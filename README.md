Information Visualization with Python and Vega-Altair

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring data visualization techniques using Python and Vega-Altair. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a dataset through various data analysis techniques and culminates in a final project with an accompanying poster.

## Contents

- **Exploratory Notebooks**: A series of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different visualizations.
- **Final Project and Poster**: A comprehensive notebook showcasing the complete analysis and visualization of the dataset. A visual summary of the project findings and key visualizations.

## Getting Started
